Solution to an interview question:

Suppose you are given an array of integers (e.g. {1, 2, 3, 4}).  If you join the elements of the array into a single number, write a method which will increment that number, with the result in array form (e.g. {1, 2, 3, 5}).  Extra credit:  Handle the {9, 9, 9, 9} case.
